# drec's ctf archive

not much to see here. solutions from past ctfs

## Why just now?

I was doing ctfs for fun, and I never thought that my efforts would be
worth documenting.

now, I'm desperate to collect the last few bits of my ctf experiences.
I didn't know that ctf experience would be worth showcasing. tbf I never knew
becoming a hacker would be a viable career path until recently.

hopefully I have a set of problems here and there
that show that I can actually do basic stuff hehe
